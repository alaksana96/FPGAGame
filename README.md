# FPGAGame
First Year FPGA Project 

This is a simple Pong/Brick Breaker hybrid game which can be played on a DE0 Board. The game was coded in C/C++ using Catapult-C as a HLS Tool in order to generate RTL files, which were then put into the Quartus project.

In order to run the game, download the whole repository as a .zip and extract and run the DE0_D5M.qpf
The actual Quartus File can be found in /student_files_2015(1)/student_files_2015/prj2/quartus_proj/DE0_CAMERA_MOUSE/DE0_D5M.qpf
